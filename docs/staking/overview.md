Welcome to the Seed Node Staking section.

## Phase 0
[Phase 0](phase0/staking-introduction) is the initial phase of seed node staking program. Phase 0 is formally described in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md).

The goal of phase 0 is 
- Open up the seed nodes network to more operators
- Introduce staking at the seed node operator level

## Phase 1
[Phase 1](phase1/staking-phase1-overview) is the upcoming phase of SSN staking. Phase 1 is formally described in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-11.md). Phase 1 is expected to replace phase 0.


Phase 1 is the continuation of phase 0 staking. Notably, phase 1
- introduce a mechanism for stake delegation, thereby removing the need to deposit $ZIL with an intermediate custodian
- introduce uncapped staking
- introduce gZIL token, a ZRC2 compliant governance token, as stake rewards
- Bonding of stake amount
