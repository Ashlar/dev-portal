# Who can run a Zilliqa SSN

The seed node operator candidates we are looking to get involved with the staked seed node program are 
(i) existing crypto exchanges, 
(ii) wallet and explorer providers, and 
(iii) eligible operators from within the Zilliqa community.

# Minimum hardware requirements
Ensuring your node meets the minimum hardware requirements is important. Having your staked seed node run without disruption will both enable you to get the maximum possible stake reward and guarantee to the users of your node that they can enjoy a seamless experience of the API service provided.

At the moment, the minimum hardware requirements are as follows:
- x64 Ubuntu operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04.05 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS)
- Quad-core server-grade processor (e.g., Intel Xeon Skylake family)
- 16GB RAM
- 300GB SSD
- 200Mbps (up/down) bandwidth
