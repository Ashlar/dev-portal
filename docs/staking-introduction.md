In this initial phase of the Zilliqa staking program, staking is done through a seed node and a smart contract on the Zilliqa blockchain. The seed node operator who wishes to host an SSN will need to register with the Zilliqa team and deposit a certain minimum number of $ZIL into the staking smart contract. The seed node operator will then receive blockchain rewards at regular intervals according to the performance of its SSN, and in proportion to the amount of $ZIL deposited in the contract during those intervals.

Staked seed nodes are expected to provide API service to anyone in order to be eligible for these rewards. There will also be no hard slashing in this phase of the program.

> More details on the rationale and design of the program can be found in the Zilliqa Improvement Proposal (ZIP) [documentation](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md).

# Who can run a Zilliqa SSN

The seed node operator candidates we are looking to get involved with the staked seed node program are 
- existing exchanges, 
- wallet and explorer providers, and 
- eligible operators from within the Zilliqa community.

# Minimum hardware requirements
Ensuring your node meets the minimum hardware requirements is important. Having your staked seed node run without disruption will both enable you to get the maximum possible stake reward and guarantee to the users of your node that they can enjoy a seamless experience of the API service provided.

At the moment, the minimum hardware requirements are as follows:
- x64 Ubuntu operating system (e.g., `Ubuntu 16.04.05 LTS`, `Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS`)
- Quad-core server-grade processor (e.g., Intel Xeon Skylake family)
- 16GB RAM
- 300GB SSD
- 200Mbps (up/down) bandwidth
- 24/7 uptime
- Public IP address
- Domain name
- Valid SSL certificate
